                <h4>Hi there, welcome to my personal website!</h4>

                <p>
                    My name is 
                    <b> Moulik Gaglani</b>
                    {' '}
                    and I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a 
                    <b> Honours Bachelor of Science</b>, 
                    {' '}
                    specialized in 
                    <b> Computer Science</b>
                    {' '}.
                </p>

                <p>I&apos;ve been a teaching assistant and have about 2 years of experience in software development including Full-stack development and DevOps; <a href='/#/resume'>check out my resume here</a>!</p>

                <p>
                    Apart from all that, I&apos;m a big fan of learning new hobbies. I absolutely love to cook (making chili paneer being my favourite), and I like 
                    <a href="/#/gallery"> take photos</a>
                    {' '}
                    on occasion.
                </p>
